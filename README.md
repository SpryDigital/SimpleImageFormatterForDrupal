Simple Image Formatter
===========================================

This is an image formatter that gives you just a simple image tag with an optional link enclosing it. It was pretty much just copied and pasted from the relavent parts of the `image` and `file_entity` modules.

Why does this exist? Because, apperantly, there is no way to get just a simple image tag out of the media suite. It used to be you could, back in version 1.x, but not so now.

How to use it
-------------

Install, enable, clear caches, and it should show up where ever iamge formatters can be found.
